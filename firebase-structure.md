# Firebase Firestore Data Structure

This document outlines the current data structure used in Firestore for the TestPoint application. This guide reflects the implemented system and is intended to help developers understand how data is stored and managed.

## Root Collections

The database consists of four primary root collections:

1. `users` - User profiles and authentication data
2. `groups` - Class/group management 
3. `tests` - Test definitions with questions subcollection
4. `test_sessions` - Individual student test-taking sessions

---

## 1. `users` Collection

This collection stores user profile information. The document ID for each user is their Firebase Authentication UID.

### Document Structure: `users/{userId}`

```json
{
  "name": "String",
  "email": "String", 
  "role": "String"
}
```

### Field Descriptions:

- **`name`**: (String) The full name of the user (e.g., "John Doe").
- **`email`**: (String) The user's email address. Unique identifier from Firebase Auth.
- **`role`**: (String) User permission level. Possible values:
  - `"admin"`: Full system access and management capabilities
  - `"teacher"`: Can create groups, tests, and view student results
  - `"student"`: Can take assigned tests and view results

### Implementation Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- User authentication via Firebase Auth
- Role-based access control implemented
- User profile management in place

---

## 2. `groups` Collection

This collection stores class/group information for organizing students and assigning tests.

### Document Structure: `groups/{groupId}`

```json
{
  "name": "String",
  "userIds": ["Array<String>"],
  "created_at": "Timestamp"
}
```

### Field Descriptions:

- **`name`**: (String) The name of the group (e.g., "Grade 10 Math Class", "Advanced Physics").
- **`userIds`**: (Array of Strings) List of Firebase Authentication UIDs of group members.
- **`created_at`**: (Timestamp) When the group was created.

### Implementation Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Group creation and management
- Student assignment to groups
- Group-based test filtering
- Real-time group updates

### Required Firebase Indexes:
- Composite index for: `userIds (array-contains)` + `name (ascending)` + `__name__ (ascending)`

---

## 3. `tests` Collection

This collection stores test definitions created by teachers.

### Document Structure: `tests/{testId}`

```json
{
  "name": "String",
  "group_id": "String", 
  "time_limit": "Number",
  "question_count": "Number",
  "date_time": "Timestamp",

    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Teachers can manage tests they created
    match /tests/{testId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        (resource == null || resource.data.test_maker == request.auth.uid);
    }
    
    // Questions are managed by test creators
    match /tests/{testId}/questions/{questionId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/tests/$(testId)).data.test_maker == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Groups are readable by all authenticated users
    match /groups/{groupId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null; // TODO: Restrict to admins/teachers
    }
    
    // Test sessions managed by students
    match /test_sessions/{sessionId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
