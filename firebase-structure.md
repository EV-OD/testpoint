# Firebase Firestore Data Structure

This document outlines the current data structure used in Firestore for the TestPoint application. This guide reflects the implemented system and is intended to help developers understand how data is stored and managed.

## Root Collections

The database consists of four primary root collections:

1. `users` - User profiles and authentication data
2. `groups` - Class/group management 
3. `tests` - Test definitions with questions subcollection
4. `test_sessions` - Individual student test-taking sessions

**Note**: The Firestore rules also reference a `test_submissions` collection, but this appears to be an alias or alternative reference to `test_sessions` for completed tests.

---

## 1. `users` Collection

This collection stores user profile information. The document ID for each user is their Firebase Authentication UID.

### Document Structure: `users/{userId}`

```json
{
  "name": "String",

  "role": "String"
}
```

### Field Descriptions:

- **`name`**: (String) The full name of the user (e.g., "John Doe").
- **`email`**: (String) The user's email address. Unique identifier from Firebase Auth.
- **`role`**: (String) User permission level. Possible values:
  - `"admin"`: Full system access and management capabilities

---

## 5. `test_submissions` Collection (Reference in Security Rules)

This collection is referenced in the Firestore security rules but appears to be an alternative interface to `test_sessions` for accessing completed test data. The actual implementation uses `test_sessions` for both active and completed tests.

### Purpose:
- Alternative query path for completed tests
- Teacher access to student submissions
- Potential future separation of active vs. completed sessions

### Security Rules: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Admins: Read access to all submissions
- Teachers: Read access to submissions for their tests
- Students: Read access to their own submissions, create permissions for accessible tests

### Current Status: 🚧 ARCHITECTURAL DECISION PENDING
- Rules exist but collection may be an alias to `test_sessions`
- Implementation currently uses `test_sessions` for all session data
- Future refactoring may separate active sessions from completed submissions

## Firebase Security Rules

### Current Implementation Status: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE RULES

The Firestore security rules implement a robust role-based access control system with proper authentication checks and data isolation.

```javascript
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Helper functions for role checking
    function isAdmin() {
      return get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    function isTeacher() {
      return get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'teacher';
    }
    
    function isStudent() {
      return get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'student';
    }
    
    function isAdminOrTeacher() {
      return isAdmin() || isTeacher();
    }

    // Users collection - Admin-managed with self-read access
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow list: if request.auth != null;
      allow get: if request.auth != null && (isAdmin() || request.auth.uid == userId);
      allow write: if request.auth != null && isAdmin();
    }

    match /groups/{groupId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && isAdminOrTeacher();
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                     isStudent() && 
                     request.auth.uid in resource.data.userIds;

                             isTeacher() && 
                             get(/databases/$(database)/documents/tests/$(testId)).data.test_maker == request.auth.uid;
        allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                       isStudent() && 
                       request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/groups/$(get(/databases/$(database)/documents/tests/$(testId)).data.group_id)).data.userIds;
      }
    }

    // Test sessions collection - Student-owned with teacher read access
    match /test_sessions/{sessionId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && isAdmin();
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                     isTeacher() &&

      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
                           isStudent() && 
                           resource.data.student_id == request.auth.uid;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
                      isStudent() && 
                      request.resource.data.student_id == request.auth.uid &&
                      request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/groups/$(get(/databases/$(database)/documents/tests/$(request.resource.data.test_id)).data.group_id)).data.userIds;
    }

    // Test submissions collection (future/alternative access)
    match /test_submissions/{submissionId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && isAdmin();
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                    isTeacher() && 
                    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/tests/$(resource.data.testId)).data.test_maker == request.auth.uid;
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                    isStudent() && 
                    resource.data.studentId == request.auth.uid;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
                     isStudent() && 
                     request.resource.data.studentId == request.auth.uid &&
                     request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/groups/$(get(/databases/$(database)/documents/tests/$(request.resource.data.testId)).data.group_id)).data.userIds;
    }

    // Default deny all other collections
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

### Security Features: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Role-based access control** with admin, teacher, and student roles
- **Data isolation** ensuring users only access authorized data
- **Creator-based permissions** for tests and questions
- **Group membership validation** for test access
- **Comprehensive authentication checks** on all operations
- **Default deny policy** for security by default

---

## Required Firebase Indexes

### Composite Indexes Created:
1. **groups collection**: 
   - Fields: `userIds` (array-contains), `name` (ascending)
   - Purpose: Student group membership queries with sorting

### Single Field Indexes (Auto-created):
- `users.role` - Role-based access control queries
- `tests.test_maker` - Filter tests by creator
- `tests.group_id` - Filter tests by assigned group
- `tests.status` - Filter by test lifecycle status
- `tests.date_time` - Sort by scheduled test time
- `tests.created_at` - Sort by creation date
- `groups.userIds` - Group membership queries  
- `groups.created_at` - Sort groups by creation date
- `test_sessions.test_id` - Find sessions for specific tests
- `test_sessions.student_id` - Find sessions for specific students
- `test_sessions.status` - Filter sessions by status
- `test_sessions.start_time` - Sort sessions by start time

### Query Optimization Notes:
- Avoided complex composite indexes by removing orderBy from array-contains queries
- Single field indexes handle most common query patterns efficiently
- Group membership queries use array-contains without additional sorting to prevent index requirements
