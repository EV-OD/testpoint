# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Anti-Cheating System is a comprehensive security framework designed to maintain academic integrity during online testing. The system monitors student behavior, detects suspicious activities, and implements preventive measures to ensure fair testing conditions. It includes app switch detection, screen pinning, activity monitoring, and automatic violation handling to create a secure testing environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the system to detect when students switch away from the test application, so that I can maintain test integrity and prevent cheating.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student switches to another application during a test THEN the system SHALL immediately detect the app switch
2. WHEN an app switch is detected THEN the system SHALL log the violation with timestamp and duration
3. WHEN an app switch occurs THEN the system SHALL display a warning message to the student
4. WHEN multiple app switches are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically submit the test and notify the teacher
5. WHEN the student returns to the test app THEN the system SHALL record the return time and continue monitoring

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the system to enable screen pinning during tests, so that students cannot navigate away from the test interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test begins THEN the system SHALL attempt to enable screen pinning on supported devices
2. WHEN screen pinning is successfully enabled THEN the system SHALL prevent navigation to other apps or system UI
3. WHEN screen pinning fails to activate THEN the system SHALL display a warning and require manual activation
4. WHEN screen pinning is disabled during a test THEN the system SHALL detect the change and trigger violation protocols
5. WHEN a test is completed or submitted THEN the system SHALL automatically disable screen pinning

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to receive detailed violation reports, so that I can review potential cheating incidents and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a violation occurs THEN the system SHALL create a detailed violation record with metadata
2. WHEN violations are logged THEN the system SHALL include student information, test details, and violation type
3. WHEN a test is submitted due to violations THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive violation report
4. WHEN teachers view test results THEN the system SHALL display any associated violation warnings
5. WHEN multiple violations occur THEN the system SHALL aggregate them into a single comprehensive report

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to understand the anti-cheating rules before starting a test, so that I can avoid accidental violations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student starts a test THEN the system SHALL display clear anti-cheating rules and consequences
2. WHEN showing rules THEN the system SHALL explain app switch detection and screen pinning requirements
3. WHEN a student acknowledges the rules THEN the system SHALL require explicit consent before proceeding
4. WHEN a violation occurs THEN the system SHALL display educational messages about the specific violation
5. WHEN rules are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide examples of prohibited and allowed behaviors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure anti-cheating sensitivity and thresholds, so that the system can be adapted to different testing environments and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN administrators SHALL be able to set violation thresholds and timeouts
2. WHEN setting thresholds THEN the system SHALL allow customization of warning vs. automatic submission triggers
3. WHEN configuring detection THEN administrators SHALL be able to enable/disable specific monitoring features
4. WHEN thresholds are modified THEN the system SHALL apply changes to new test sessions immediately
5. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL log the changes for audit purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the system to prevent screenshot and screen recording during tests, so that test content cannot be captured and shared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test session starts THEN the system SHALL enable screenshot prevention on supported platforms
2. WHEN screenshot prevention is active THEN the system SHALL block system screenshot functionality
3. WHEN screen recording is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to block it and log a violation
4. WHEN screenshot/recording prevention fails THEN the system SHALL warn the student and log the security limitation
5. WHEN a test ends THEN the system SHALL restore normal screenshot and recording capabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a student, I want to receive clear warnings before violations result in test submission, so that I can correct my behavior and continue the test.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a first violation occurs THEN the system SHALL display a warning message with clear explanation
2. WHEN showing warnings THEN the system SHALL indicate how many violations remain before automatic submission
3. WHEN a warning is displayed THEN the system SHALL pause the test timer until the student acknowledges
4. WHEN multiple warnings accumulate THEN the system SHALL show increasingly urgent messaging
5. WHEN the final violation threshold is reached THEN the system SHALL provide a brief final warning before submission
